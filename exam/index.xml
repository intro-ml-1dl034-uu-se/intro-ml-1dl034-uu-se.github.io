A multiple choice section, normally of 20 questions. You have to get 80% on this part to get a 3. A second part of harder questions that require more in depth knowledge. This part of the exam is for students aiming for a 4 or a 5. Some hold exams can be found here. There are no specimen answer. If you send me your answers, then I will tell you what mark you would get, and how to improve the answer if needed.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-uk</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/exam/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
