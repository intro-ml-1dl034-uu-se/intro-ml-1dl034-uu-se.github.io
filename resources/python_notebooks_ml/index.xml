If you wish to do the same then please read on. Note that I did home some problems installing skikit-image on a new Apple with M1 silicon, but after upgrading the latest version of the operating system and doing and updating my homebrew setup everything works. Note that these instructions are for using pip. If you are using an alternative package manager such as Anaconda then you are on your own. I know nothing about setting up Python on a windows machine.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/resources/python_notebooks_ml/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
