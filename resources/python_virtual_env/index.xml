If you are windows there are other options such as AnaConda. You also have problems with integrating with various windows IDEs. If you are using windows then maybe these instructions are useful.
In a lot of my courses I encourage students to use python virtual environments. Virtual environments are a great way of making sure that you have the correct version of packages installed. This is very short cheat sheet on how to set them up. I will assume that we are using python 3. Luckily python 3 has virtual environments set up. It is all in the documentation, but then sometimes people are too lazy to google, or do not know what to google for.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/resources/python_virtual_env/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
