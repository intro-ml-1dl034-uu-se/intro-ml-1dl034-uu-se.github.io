<p><em>Anaconda</em> is a distribution of Python and R that includes many popular Data Science packages, such as Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. For numerous reasons, it is suggested for working with Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of installation:</strong> Anaconda comes with a built-in package
manager called <em>conda</em>, which makes it easy to install and manage
packages, including Jupyter Notebook. Anaconda also automatically
manages dependencies between packages, so you do not have to worry
about conflicts between different versions of packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrated development environment (IDE):</strong> Anaconda includes an
IDE called <em>Anaconda Navigator</em>, which provides a user-friendly
interface for managing your Python environment and launching
Jupyter Notebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large collection of pre-installed packages:</strong> Anaconda comes with
a large collection of pre-installed packages, which can save you a
lot of time compared to installing each package individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual environment management:</strong> Anaconda comes with conda which
is a powerful virtual environment manager that allows you to create
and manage multiple isolated environments, each with its own set of
packages. This can help you to avoid conflicts between packages and
maintain reproducibility of your projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we know the advantages of using Anaconda, we proceed with a
detailed explanation of how to install anaconda and subsequently open
Jupyter notebooks through Anaconda. There are two options to do this.</p>
<p><strong>First option</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, download the Anaconda distribution for Windows from
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank">https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the download is complete, double-click the installer file to
begin the installation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the
installation. During this process, you will be prompted to select
the installation location. By default, Anaconda will be installed
in the C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3 folder, but you can choose a
different location if you prefer. The next screen is the Advanced
Installation Options. Here you have some additional options like if
you want to add anaconda to your PATH variable, and if you want to
register Anaconda as your default Python. Make sure you check the
&ldquo;Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable&rdquo; option, it will make
your life easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the installation is complete, open the Start menu and search
for &ldquo;Anaconda Prompt&rdquo;. Click on the Anaconda Prompt shortcut to
open a command prompt window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the command prompt window, type the following command to verify
that Anaconda is installed correctly: conda &ndash;version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we need to create a virtual environment in which to install
Jupyter Notebook. In the Anaconda prompt, type the following
command: conda create -n env_name , replacing env_name with the
name you want to give to your virtual environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the environment is created, activate it by typing the
following command: conda activate env_name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the virtual environment is active, we can install Jupyter
Notebook by typing the following command: conda install jupyter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Jupyter Notebook is installed, we can start the Jupyter
Notebook server by typing the following command in the Anaconda
prompt: jupyter notebook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will open a web browser window with the Jupyter Notebook
interface. From here, you can create new notebooks, open existing
notebooks, and run code cells.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a step by step explanation of how to install Anaconda and how
to open Jupyter Notebook through the Anaconda prompt, however, with
the installation of Anaconda it comes Anaconda Navigator. This is a
graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to easily manage your
Anaconda environments and packages, as well as launch Jupyter Notebook
and other applications. Let us see how to open Jupyter Notebook with
Anaconda Navigator (more intuitive than the first option).</p>
<p><strong>Second option</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You can find it by
searching for &ldquo;Anaconda Navigator&rdquo; in the Start menu (Windows) or
Spotlight (Mac).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Anaconda Navigator window is open, you should see Jupyter
Notebook in the list of applications. Click on the &ldquo;Launch&rdquo; button
next to Jupyter Notebook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new tab will open in your default web browser, and you will be
taken to the Jupyter Notebook interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should see the list of files and directories in the current
working directory, you can navigate to the desired folder and
create a new notebook by clicking the &ldquo;New&rdquo; button on the right
corner and select &ldquo;Python 3&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
