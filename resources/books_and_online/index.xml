There are a lot of books on machine learning, some more theoretical and some more practical. It is difficult to recommend a book that fits the background for all students on this course. Some books are too mathematical and some books are too practical. The course has two recommended text books. One is more theoretical, and one is more hands on with Python. Both of them cover most of the material in the course.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/resources/books_and_online/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
