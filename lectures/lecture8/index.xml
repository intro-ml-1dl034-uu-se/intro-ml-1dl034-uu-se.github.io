Constructing the optimal decision tree for an arbitrary data set is yet another NP-hard question, and there are many algorithms available. In this lecture you will look at one of the simpler algorithm ID3. ID3 uses information theory to decide how to construct a tree.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/lectures/lecture8/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
