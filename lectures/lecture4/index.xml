Logistic Regression Logistic regression, overfitting and regularisation. Again Logistic regression is an algorithm that comes from statistics, but it can also seen as a machine learning algorithm. The hypothesis is very similar to linear regression is it a set of values that defines a linear function. The difference between logistic regression and linear regression is the linear function goes through a logistic function that works as a threshold function. Unlike linear regression it is not possible to solve the model exactly, and gradient descent is necessary.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/lectures/lecture4/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
