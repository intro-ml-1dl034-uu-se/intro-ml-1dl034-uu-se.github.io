Todayâ€™s Topics: Ensemble Learning Ensemble learning is a simple idea. Instead of training one model, we train multiple models and combine the results. A popular ensemble learning algorithm is random forests that combines many decision trees that are trained on random subsets of the features. To build a classifier a majority vote is taken. There are various techniques to improve the system including boosting, bagging and gradient boosting. As you will see below these are not limited to random forests, but to other combinations of learning algorithms. There is a lot extensions and refinements of ensemble methods including AdaBoost. We will only cover gradient boosting and not go too much into the mathematics behind ensemble learning (that is reserved for a more advanced course). The aim of this lecture is to give you access to another powerful machine learning technique.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/lectures/lecture10/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
