It is important not to get K-nearest neighbours and K-means clustering confused.
The K-means algorithm works by gradient descent. Unlike a lot of the algorithms that we have been looking at, K-means often suffers from the problem of many local minima. In Andrew Ng’s lectures you will meet various ways of dealing with local minima.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/lectures/lecture7/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
