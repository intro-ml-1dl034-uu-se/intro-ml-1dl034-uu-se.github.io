Support vector machines deal with noisy data, where some labels are miss-classified, with large-margin classifiers.
Support vector machines can also do non-linear classification using kernels. A kernel is a non-linear transformation of the input data into a higher dimensional space. Kernels transform your input data into a space where it is possible to do linear separation as in logistic regression.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en</language><managingEditor>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</managingEditor><webMaster>justin.pearson@it.uu.se (Justin Pearson)</webMaster><atom:link href="https://intro-ml-1dl034-uu-se.github.io/lectures/lecture5/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
