where we can do the calculations directly. We are classifying
micro-tweets of exactly 3 words. Our training set is as follows. $S$
indicates that a message is spam and $\neg S$ indicates that a
message is not spam.

word $w = \mathrm{money}$.
Bayes' Theorem should be familiar to you by now:
$$
P(S|w) = \frac{P(w|S)P(S)}{P(w)}
$$
$P(S|w)$ is the even that an email is Spam given that the word $w$
occurs in it. Using Bayes theorem we can calculate the probability
that a message containing the word $w$ is spam. We can estimate the
values $P(w|S)$, $P(S)$ and $P(w)$ from out data set.
$$
P(S) = \frac{\mathrm{number\ spam}}{\mathrm{total\ messages}} = \frac{6}{10}
$$
To estimate $P(w|S)$ we have to count the number of times that a
particular word occurs in a spam message. So
$$
P(\mathrm{money}|S) = \frac{5}{6}
$$
When you are only considering a single word then estimating $P(\mathrm{money})$
is easy. It is the ratio of the number of tweets that contain the
word 'money' and the total number of tweets. The word money appears in
$7$ tweets. So
$$
P(\mathrm{money}) = \frac{7}{10}
$$
So if we get a message that contains the word 'money' we can calculate
the probability that it is a spam message. $$ P(S|\mathrm{money}) =
\frac{P(w|S)P(S)}{P(w)} = \frac{\frac{5}{6}\frac{6}{10}}{\frac{7}{10}}
= \frac{5}{10}\frac{10}{7} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.71 $$ There is an
important identity that will become useful later on $$
P(\mathrm{money}) = P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(S) +
P(\mathrm{money}|\neg S)P(\neg S) $$ So $$
P(\mathrm{money})= \frac{5}{6}\frac{6}{10} + \frac{2}{4}\frac{4}{10} =
\frac{7}{10} $$</span><h2 id=first-pitfall-estimating-the-probabilities>First Pitfall: Estimating the probabilities</h2><span class="math align-center">So how to we estimate the probabilities $P(w|S)$ , $P(S)$ and $P(w)$?
What do they really mean? The probabilities $P(S)$ and $P(\neg S$) are
unambiguous. They are just the probability that a tweet is spam or
not. But $P(w|S)$, $P(w|\neg S)$, and $P(w)$ can mean different things
depending exactly which model we use to calculate the probabilities.</span><p>There are two models:</p><ul><li><p>(A): <span class="math align-center">To calculate $P(\mathrm{money}|S)$. There are 6
messages that are spam and in those 6 messages 5 of them (1,2,3,4,5)
contain the word money so $P(\mathrm{money}|S) = 5/6$, and of the 10
messages 7 of them (1,2,3,4,5,9,10) contain the word 'money' so
$P(\mathrm{money}) = 7/10$. This is exactly what we did above.</span></p></li><li><p>(B): <span class="math align-center">To calculate $P(\mathrm{money})$ there are $10\times 3 = 30$
words in our training set and the word money appears 10 times so
$$P(\mathrm{money}) = 10/30.$$ To calculate $P(\mathrm{money}|S)$
there are 6 spam messages each of 3 words long. In the words of the
spam messages the word 'money' appears 8 times. So $$
P(\mathrm{money} | S) = \frac{8}{3 \times 6} = \frac{8}{18} =
\frac{4}{9} $$
The probability a message being spam is still
$6/10$. So
if I get the message 'money for nothing' then the probability that
it is spam is calculated as before $$ P(S|\mathrm{money}) =
\frac{P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(S)}{P(\mathrm{money})} =
\frac{{\frac{8}{3 \times 6}\times \frac{6}{10}}}{ \frac{10}{30}} =
\frac{8}{10} $$
It seems that if spammers are prone to repeat words in their
message then this increases the probability that a message
containing that word is spam.</span></p></li></ul><span class="math align-center">So how do you calculate the probability that the message 'money money
mammon' is spam? In model (A) it does not matter how many times 'money'
appears in a message: you only count the number of messages 'money'
appears in. While in model (B) there is some weighting of the number
of times that a word appears. But to calculate
$P(S|\mathrm{money}^2)$ (where is short hand for 'money appearing
twice) we have calculate $P(\mathrm{money}^2|S)$. How you do this
depends a bit on your model and the assumptions underlying the
model. We'll get to that later.</span><details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Take Home Message</summary><div class=box-content><h2 id=take-home-message>Take home message</h2><p>So the first take home message is be careful how you count the words
and how you calculate the probabilities. If you confuse model (A) and

times a word appears in a message. We are only interested if the word
appears on the message or not.
One word is not going to much of a spam classifier. Even in our little
data set above, the word &lsquo;money&rsquo; can appear in spam and non spam
messages. We will get a better classifier if we take into account more
words. Our data set is quite small and for each word we can count the
number of times it appears in a spam tweet and the number of times it
appears in a non-spam tweet.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Word</th><th>occurrences in spam</th><th>occurrences in non spam</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_1 = \mathrm{money}$</span></td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_2 = \mathrm{world}$</span></td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_3 = \mathrm{viagra}$</span></td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_4 = \mathrm{aardvark}$</span></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_5 = \mathrm{heart}$</span></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_6 = \mathrm{boondoggle}$</span></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_7 = \mathrm{honey}$</span></td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_8 = \mathrm{back}$</span></td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><span class="math align-center">$w_9 = \mathrm{now}$</span></td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="math align-center">You can turn these counts into probabilities, and thus you can
calculate quantities like $P(\mathrm{money}|S) = 5/6$,
$P(\mathrm{money}|\neg S) = 2/4$.
Suppose I receive a message 'viagra money boondoggle' what is the
probability that it is spam message? When we use Bayes' theorem we
have to calculate $$P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle}|S)$$ where $$\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money}
\land \mathrm{boondoggle}$$ is the event that the words 'viagra',
'money' and 'boondoggle' appears in a message.</span><h2 id=the-naive-in-naive-bayes>The Naive in Naive Bayes</h2><span class="math align-center">We need to make an independence assumption. In a spam or non spam
message the probability of words are independent. That is
$$
P(w_1 \land w_2 \land \cdots \land w_n | S) = P(w_1|S)P(w_1|S) \cdots
P(w_n|S)
$$
and
$$
P(w_1 \land w_2 \land \cdots \land w_n | \neg S) = P(w_1|\neg S)P(w_1|\neg S) \cdots
P(w_n|\neg S)
$$
Note this is a weaker assumption than simply saying
$$
P(w_1 \cdots w_n) = \prod_{1\leq i \leq n} P(w_i)
$$</span><h2 id=take-home-message>Take home message</h2><span class="math align-center">Note that because we have made the assumptions that
$$P(w_1 \land w_2
\land \cdots \land w_n | S) =
\prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i|S)$$
and
$$P(w_1 \land w_2 \land \cdots \land w_n | S) =
\prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i|S)$$
it does not make sense to directly estimate the probabilities of
$P(w_i)$ directly from the data set. Later on we will see that you do
actually need the probabilities $P(w_1 \cdots w_n)$ to decide if a
message is spam or not. If you want to calculate the probability
$P(w_1 \cdots w_n)$ then you must use the identity $P(w_1 \cdots
w_n)$ equals
$$
P(w_1 \cdots w_n|S)P(S) + P(w_1 \cdots w_n|\neg S)P(\neg S)
$$</span><p>The independence assumption is why Naive Bayes is referred to as
naive. Although this model could be improved. It seems that the
probability of one word appearing in a message should not be
independent of another word. If a spammer write &lsquo;money&rsquo; then he is
likely to also include &lsquo;viagra&rsquo; in the message. Even so, assuming
independence works very well in practice.</p><h2 id=calculating-the-spam-probability>Calculating the spam probability.</h2><span class="math align-center">We can now apply Bayes' theorem $P(S | \mathrm{viagra} \land
\mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle})$ equals $$ \frac{
P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle}|S)
P(S)}{P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle})} $$
From the independence assumption we have that $P(S | \mathrm{viagra}
\land \mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle})$ equals $$ \frac{
P(\mathrm{viagra}|S)P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(\mathrm{boondoggle}|S)P(S)}
{P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle})} $$
To calculate $P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle})$ we use the identity above.
Taking product $$P(\mathrm{viagra})P(\mathrm{money})P(\mathrm{boondoggle})$$
is the wrong answer.
So instead we get that $P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle})$ equals
$P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle}|S)P(S)$ plus $P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle}|\neg S)P(\neg S)$.
The by the independence assumption
$P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle}|S)$ equals
$$
P(\mathrm{viagra}|S)P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(\mathrm{boondoggle}|S) =
\frac{2}{6}\frac{5}{6}\frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{108}
$$
Putting the numbers in we get $P(\mathrm{viagra} \land \mathrm{money} \land
\mathrm{boondoggle})$ equals
$$ \left(\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot
\frac{1}{6}\right)\frac{6}{10} + \left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot
\frac{2}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{4}\right)\frac{4}{10} \approx 0.08
$$
So $P(S|\mathrm{viagra} \land
\mathrm{money} \land \mathrm{boondoggle})$ equals
$$
\frac{\frac{5}{108}\frac{6}{10}}{0.08} \approx 0.35
$$</span><h2 id=not-calculating-the-whole-probability>Not calculating the whole probability.</h2><span class="math align-center">When implementing the spam filter we do not actually need to calculate
the denominators. We just compare the expressions
$P(\mathrm{viagra}|S)P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(\mathrm{boondoggle}|S)P(S)$
and
$P(\mathrm{viagra}|\neg S)P(\mathrm{money}|\neg S)P(\mathrm{boondoggle}|\neg S)P(\neg S)$
and see which one is bigger. This is also important because some of
the numbers start getting smaller and smaller and you end up with
floating point underflow errors. If the numbers get too small then you
have to calculate with the logarithm of the probability and do
additions rather than multiplication.</span><h2 id=laplacian-smoothing>Laplacian Smoothing</h2><span class="math align-center">What if we have the message 'now money viagra', if we look at our data
set the word 'now' has not appeared in a spam message. There could be
two reasons for this, one is that a spam message will never contain
the word 'now' (unlikely), or that we just do not have a spam message
with 'now' appearing in our training set. If we use model (A) and
calculate the probability that our message is spam we get
$P(S|\mathrm{now}\land\mathrm{money}\land{viagra})$ equals
$$
\frac{P(\mathrm{now}|S)P(\mathrm{money}|S)P(\mathrm{viagra}|S)P(S)}{P(\mathrm{now}\land\mathrm{money}\land\mathrm{viagra})}
$$
which equals
$$\frac{0 \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot
\frac{2}{6}\frac{6}{10}}{P(\mathrm{now}\land\mathrm{money}\land\mathrm{viagra})}
$$
So even though the words 'money' and 'viagra' are pretty good
indicators of a message being spam we get probability 0.
To get around this we add one to all our counts to avoid probability
$0$ estimates and adjust the total count so as to avoid any
probabilities greater than $1$. So in model (A) if we are considering
$9$ words as a above then we estimate $P(\mathrm{now}|S)$ to be
$$
\frac{0 + 1}{6 + 1}
$$
instead of
$$
\frac{0}{6}
$$
If you had a word that appeared in all 6 of the spam tweets then you
would get an estimate $\frac{6+1}{6+1}$ which would be $1$.
I leave it an exercise to work out the correct thing to do in model
(B).</span><h2 id=feature-modelling>Feature Modelling</h2><span class="math align-center">All most all machine learning algorithms require numbers and vectors as
inputs. Our Naive Bayes classifier does not really work with words,
but feature vectors. There are different possible models, but we use
something similar to model (A). First we take our data set and find
the first $n$ most popular words. The most popular word a data set
consisting of English messages is typically the word 'the'. You can
improve things by filtering out the most popular words that don't
contribute much a message being (referred to as stop words). We will
not worry about that here. But a word like 'the' is equally likely to
appear in a spam tweet or a non spam tweet, so it is better to ignore
it.
Then we turn each message into a vector of length $n$ where each entry
is $1$ or $0$, and the $i$th entry is $1$ if the message contains the
$i$th most popular word. So in a typical English message data set
'the' is the most popular and 'to' is the second most popular word. So
if our message contained the words 'to the' then the first two entries
of its feature vector would have the value $1$. $$ f = (f_1, \ldots ,
f_i, \ldots, f_n) $$ Where $f_i$ is $1$ if the $i$th most popular word
$w_i$ occurs in the message and $0$ otherwise.
It is easy to write a function takes a message and turns it into our
feature vector. Given our training set we can estimate two
probabilities for our two classes <span class="math align-center">$S$ </span>and <span class="math align-center">$\neg S$ </span>, $P(w_i|S)$, $P(\overline{w}_i|S)$, $P(w_i| \neg S)$ and $P(\overline{w}_i |
\neg S)$, where $w_i$ is the even that word $i$ occurs in the
message and $\overline{w}_i$ is the event that word $i$ does not occur
in the message.
In our example above we only have $9$ words in our data set and they
appear in order of popularity as 'money', 'world', 'viagra',
'aardvark', 'heart', 'boondoogle' , 'honey', 'back' , 'now'. You have
to break ties (words that are equally popular) and you have to do it
consistently. So give the message 'aardvark money now' its feature
vector would be $$ f = (1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1) $$
This vector $f$ corresponds to the event
$$
w_1\overline{w}_2\overline{w}_3w_4\overline{w}_5\overline{w}_6\overline{w}_7w_8
$$
So to use Bayes' theorem to work on the probability that the tweet
is is spam we have to
calculate the quantity
$$
\frac{P(w_1\overline{w}_2\overline{w}_3w_4\overline{w}_5\overline{w}_6\overline{w}_7\overline{w}_8|S)P(S)}{P(w_1\overline{w}_2\overline{w}_3w_4\overline{w}_5\overline{w}_6\overline{w}_7\overline{w}_8
w_9)}
$$
Calculating
$P(w_1\overline{w}_2\overline{w}_3w_4\overline{w}_5\overline{w}_6\overline{w}_7\overline{w}_8|S)$
is easily done by the independence assumption. It is the product of
the terms
$P(w_1|S)$,$P(\overline{w}_2|S)$,$P(\overline{w}_3|S)$,$P(w_4|S)$,$P(\overline{w}_5|S)$,$P(\overline{w}_6|S)$,$P(\overline{w}_7|S)$
and $P(\overline{w}_8|S)$. All these values are easily estimated from
our data set. For example $P(\overline{w}_3|S)$ is the probability
that the word 'money' does not appear in a spam tweet. We had 6 spam
tweets and 5 of them contained the word money and so we get that
$P(\overline{w}_3|S)$ equals $1/6$.</span><h2 id=model-a-and-feature-vectors>Model (A) and Feature Vectors</h2><span class="math align-center">If you go back to model (A) and you try to estimate if a message is
spam or not, then using the same message we would only need to
calculate
$$
\frac{P(w_1|S)(w_4|S)P(w_9|S)P(S)}{P(w_1\land w_w \land w_3)}
$$
since $w_1$ is 'money', $w_4$ is 'aardvark' and $w_9$ is 'now'. We
are throwing away information about the words that do not occur in the
tweet. Does this matter? More importantly is this calculation
incorrect.
To simply things imagine that we only had two words in our feature
vector $W_1$ and $W_2$. Then given a message there are 4 possible
atomic events:
$$ W_1 W_2, W_1 \overline{W}_2, \overline{W}_1 W_2, \overline{W}_1
\overline{W_2}$$
What do we mean when we write $P(W_1|S)$? Looking at our atomic
events we actually mean
$$
P( W_1 W_2 \lor W_1\overline{W}_2|S)
$$
Any event is a union of the atomic events in your probability model.
Using the independence assumption for $W_1$ and $W_2$ and the basic
rule of probability that $P(A\lor B)$ equals $P(A)+P(B)$ when then
events $A$ and $B$ are independent atomic events we get that
$P(W_1|S)$ equals $P( W_1 W_2 \lor W_1\overline{W}_2|S)$ which equals
$$
P(W_1|S)P(W_2|S) +
P(W_1|S)P(\overline{W}_2|S)$$ refactoring gives
$$P(W_1|S)(P(W_2|S) +
P(\overline{W}_2|S))
$$
and since $P(W_2|S) + P(\overline{W}_2|S)$ equals $1$ we get
$P(W_1|S)$.
So if we ignore any information about $W_2$ then we get a factor of
$1$. If we use what information we have about $W_2$ then we get a
better estimate for the probability. You can show that the same
applies if you have lots of words in your feature vector. So our
original model (A) is not wrong, but the feature vector model where we
take into account if a word appears or not when we are estimating the
probabilities and gives a better estimate if the word is spam or
not. Note the above argument depends on our independence assumption
(the naive in Naive Bayes).
If you did not look at any words then the only information that you
would have is $P(S)$ or $P(\neg S)$ as you look at more words in
your feature you get a better estimate of the probability that the
message is spam or not.</span><h2 id=model-b-with--multiple-words>Model (B) with multiple words</h2><span class="math align-center">How do you calculate the probability that the message 'money money
boondoggle' is spam? We have already assumed that the probabilities of
a words occurring in a spam or non-spam tweet are independent. If we
also assume that the probability of a word appearing $k$ times is
$$
P(w^k|S) = P(w|S)^k
$$
That is each occurrence is independent, then we can calculate the
probability that a message containing the multiple occurrences of a
word is spam or not, but only if you use model (B) to calculate the
probabilities. You should not mix up model (A) and model (B). It does
not make sense in model (A) to ask what the probability of a word
occurring $k$ times in a spam message is. We can only ask if a m
message contains the word or not.<details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>

entries are $0$ or $1$. Given a feature vector $f$ the entry $i$th
entry is $1$ if the word appears in the message and $0$ otherwise.
Instead we would have a feature vector where the $ith$ entry tells you
how many times the word appears in the message. Thus for our message 'money money
boondoggle' its feature vector would be (using the same ordering as
above):
$$
(2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)
$$
Again it is not hard to use the information that a word appears $0$
times.</span><h2 id=take-home-messages>Take home messages</h2><ul><li><p>Are you using model (A) or model (B). Don&rsquo;t get them confused,
