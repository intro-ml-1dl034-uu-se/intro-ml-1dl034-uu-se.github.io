The exam has two parts:
A multiple choice section, normally of 20 questions. You have to get 80% on this part to get a 3. A second part of harder questions that require more in depth knowledge. This part of the exam is for students aiming for a 4 or a 5. Some hold exams can be found here. There are no specimen answer. If you send me your answers, then I will tell you what mark you would get, and how to improve the answer if needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
