<h3 id="andrew-ngs-material">Andrew Ng&rsquo;s material.</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng" target="_blank">Andrew Ng</a> is one of the
giants in machine learning. He has written numerous very important
papers, and it one of the founders of
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>.</p>
<p>He has made of videos on machine learning of various formats. He is a
far better lecturer than me, and his lectures will be of much higher
quality than I can record. Some of his lectures are on a whiteboard
and some of them are him talking over his slides. I prefer him talking
over slides and the playlist on youtube can be found
<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Somebody
has put the slides that he used on
<a href="https://github.com/tuanavu/coursera-stanford/tree/master/machine_learning" target="_blank">here</a>,
and <a href="https://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/" target="_blank">here</a> you can find notes on
the lectures. The following <a href="https://github.com/mxc19912008/Andrew-Ng-Machine-Learning-Notes" target="_blank">Github
repository</a>
has his course notes, although they are a bit too advanced for this course.</p>
<h3 id="other-online-lectures">Other Online Lectures</h3>
<p>If you find  some particular good online lectures, then please email
them to me.</p>
<p>So far:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a good channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC79Gv3mYp6zKiSwYemEik9A" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>
that has lots of machine learning videos with some real Python
examples in that illustrate many of the concepts in this course.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="machine-learning-terminology">Machine Learning Terminology</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different terms in machine learning that refer to
the same thing. A good resource is</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary" target="_blank">Google&rsquo;s Machine Learning
Glossary</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="text-books-and-other-material">Text Books and other material.</h2>
<p>All the material in this course is standard material. There are a lot
of books on machine learning, some more theoretical and some more
practical.  It is difficult to recommend a book that fits the
background for all students on this course. Some books are too
mathematical and some books are too practical.</p>
<p>If you buy one book then I recommend</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e006ab708ad44360dfa0046b2f7d0561" class="lightbox-link"><img src="https://d2sofvawe08yqg.cloudfront.net/theMLbook/hero?1549509109" alt="Cover of the Hundered-Page Machine Learning
Book" class="figure-image noborder lightbox noshadow" style="height: auto; width: auto;" loading="lazy"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-e006ab708ad44360dfa0046b2f7d0561"><img src="https://d2sofvawe08yqg.cloudfront.net/theMLbook/hero?1549509109" alt="Cover of the Hundered-Page Machine Learning
Book" class="lightbox-image noborder lightbox noshadow" loading="lazy"></a>.</p>
<p>It can be found <a href="http://themlbook.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can buy an
electronic version of the book for as little as $20. Unfortunately the
book is not available the university library. If you follow the link
above you can access individual chapters of the book. In the lecture
notes I will give references to the book. The book being a little over
100 pages (141) does not go into all the topics in detail, and omit
some background material  that is necessary for some students. My
advice is to start there, and move onto other references for more
background or more detail.</p>
<h2 id="other-books-and-resources">Other Books and resources</h2>
<p>In the course we
are going to use Python and
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a> for a lot of the
assignments. The <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html" target="_blank">user
guide</a> not only
contains a lot of examples, but also a lot of the background
mathematics. I strongly recommend the dive into
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a>&rsquo;s website.  You are
also going to use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a> to parse input
data, <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">numpy</a> for fast manipulation and processing
of arrays, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">matplotlib</a> to plot data. All
these libraries have extensive documentation with examples.</p>
<h2 id="technical-assistance">Technical assistance</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://user.it.uu.se/~justin/Hugo/post/python_notebooks_ml/" target="_blank">How to</a> run Python notebooks locally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-recommended-text-books">Other recommended text books</h2>
<p>There are a lot of books on machine learning. Some are very
theoretical that go into great depth, and some contain a lot of hands
on material that you can use in your own projects. The following list
contains some books that I have found useful, together with links to
the online text at the <a href="https://www.ub.uu.se/" target="_blank">university
library</a>. The university library has a lot of
online resources on machine learning, as well as access to
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s</a> book catalogue.</p>
<p>I used to put up direct links to the books at the University Library,
but these links are never stable. To find the books below such for
them. You can access the contents of books by logging in via
CAS.  The system is a bit flaky, and sometimes you
might have to refresh the book&rsquo;s page for the system to notice that
you have logged on.</p>
